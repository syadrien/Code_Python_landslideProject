# Code_Landslide_project
Final goal: assessing the influence of several parameter on landslide occurrence 
Landslide susceptibility methods were used to examine the effect of risk factors on landslide as well as producing landslide hazard maps. Independent parameter investigated are: geomorphology, land use and climate.
Landslide Susceptibility map were produced using a frequency ratio method and a logistic regression analysis. Prediction performance of each model was assessed by comparing the existing landslide data with the LSI map using a ROC curve.
Requires various intermediate steps, including: Data preprocessing (data cleaning and exploration), especially for climatic data

Note : the input data/table are not uploaded because coming from the French Weather Forecast database, not Open Source
